    AI-DOCSTRING: Drafted with AI; logic verified by Aftab.
    AI-ASSISTED: ChatGPT suggested the thin façade pattern over lower-level helpers
        (`_discover`, `_fetch`, `write_manifest_csv`), threading a `progress` flag into a
        `_maybe_tqdm` wrapper, adding a `limit` param for quick tests, adopting a
        continue-on-error policy in batch downloads, and exposing a `write_manifest(...)`
        convenience for reproducible outputs. — Aftab
